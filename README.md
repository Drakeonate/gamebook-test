# Unity Developer Exercise

Hi there and welcome to Gamebook!

With this exercise we want to shed some light on your architectural skills.  
We've created a somehow worst-case scenario of code that needs to be refactored according to industry standard design patterns and the SOLID principles. Additionally we sprinkled a lot of small errors and “don’t-ever’s” in there, so you have to pay attention to detail and question every line.  

We're also quite sensitive to naming and format conventions, so follow the [Microsoft .Net standard guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229002(v=vs.110).aspx) and optionally [CodeMaid](http://www.codemaid.net/) can help you with basic formatting.

## Your specific tasks are:
* Refactor the code based on SOLID principles
* Use dependency injection where applicable
* Design a system architecture that is scalable
* Remove singletons
* Use interfaces
* Follow a clean naming convention and class format
* Follow the one-class-per-file convention
* Put comments where needed

## Requirements:
* [Unity 2020.3.x](http://unity3d.com/get-unity)

There is no strict time constraint, just send us over your solution whenever you are satisfied with the result and let us know how much time you invested overall.  
Enjoy the test and we're looking forward to the result!
